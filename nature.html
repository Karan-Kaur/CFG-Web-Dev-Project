            <h2>Green and blue spaces and mental health</h2>
            <p>
           Natural environments and accessible green and blue spaces play a direct and indirect role in
            health and well-being. They can mitigate climate change impacts and lower the risks of disasters,
            as well as support active recreation; they provide a place to relax and leave daily stress behind
            for a while. Recent studies have shown that being able to spend time in nature is something that
            communities experiencing COVID-19 lockdowns have particularly missed.
            Although it has long been understood that green and blue spaces play an important role in addressing
            both human and ecosystem health, it has only been in recent times that these relationships have
            been specifically investigated. This has become even more important within the context of needing
            to adapt planning and land use to several social and environmental challenges, such as urban
            deprivation, biodiversity loss, pollution and climate change.
            The WHO European Centre for Environment and Health (ECEH) has been following these
            developments in scientific research, while paying particular attention to mental health. Mental
            health is fundamental to our ability to think, express ourselves, interact with each other, make
            a living and enjoy life. The natural and built environment of cities and their neighbourhoods
            can affect our mental health.

          <h2>Therapeutic Horticulture</h2>
          <p>Social and therapeutic horticulture is the process of using plants and gardens to improve physical and mental health, as well as communication and thinking skills.
            Gardening is a wonderfully flexible medium that can transform lives and Thrive sees first-hand how gardening can help everyone, regardless of age or disability.
            
            Social and therapeutic horticulture uses the garden as a safe and secure place to develop someone's ability to mix socially, make friends and learn practical skills that will help them to be more independent.
            
            Using gardening tasks and the garden itself, Thrive's horticultural therapists build a set of activities for each gardener to improve their particular health needs and to work on certain goals they want to achieve.Horticultural therapy is defined as “participation in horticultural activities facilitated by a registered horticultural therapist to achieve specific goals within an established treatment, rehabilitation, or vocational plan.” It takes place within the bounds of an established treatment plan, and it’s an active process where “the process itself is considered the therapeutic activity rather than the end product.”

            Meanwhile, therapeutic horticulture is pretty much the exact thing with a slightly different emphasis; it too is all about the “process through which participants enhance their well-being through active or passive involvement in plant and plant-related activities,” but it’s less yoked to an established treatment plan—meaning, those of us who haven’t been directly prescribed a horticulture-based treatment plan by our doctors but are still using the same basic tenets to feel better could be described as engaging in therapeutic horticulture.
            
            Horticultural therapy and therapeutic horticulture are two sides of the same coin—the former more formal and the latter more informal. Think patients gardening as part of a program versus you in your backyard with your hands in the soil. In the end, both are versions of the same idea and have similar processes and end goals; one is just medically prescribed while the other is not.

          <h2>Ecotherapy</h2>
          <p>Historically, green prescribing has referred to the use of physical activity as part of a patient’s health management plan (Green Prescriptions, 2016). More recently, green prescribing has referred to the use of nature-based activities for improving the physical and mental health of individuals (Robinson & Breed, 2019). This practice is part of social prescribing which allows healthcare providers to refer patients to local, non-clinical services (What Is Social Prescribing?, 2017) . Common activities used in green prescribing include walking and cycling in nature, conservation activities, horticulture and meditation (Robinson & Breed, 2019).</p>
          <p>Greater access to green space is connected to better health and wellbeing. Doing activities in green spaces or simply spending time in nature is beneficial in different ways. For example, going for a walk at their local park can help patients manage their weight and prevent chronic non-communicable diseases such as diabetes and hypertension (Improving Access to Greenspace. A New Review for 2020, 2020). Green spaces also promote a sense of being connected to nature as well as encouraging social connections with others. These connections are good for our mental health and wellbeing, helping us experience lower levels of stress, fatigue and anxiety, among other benefits (Improving Access to Greenspace. A New Review for 2020, 2020).
          
               Interacting with green spaces is particularly beneficial for vulnerable populations. Those with greater access to green space experience lower levels of health inequalities linked to income deprivation (Mitchell & Popham, 2008).
